## What's the Jenkins Operator?

The Jenkins Operator is a [Kubernetes Native Operator](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) which manages operations for Jenkins on Kubernetes.
It has been built with Immutability and declarative Configuration as Code in mind.


## Preliminaries

Considering that this Operator is created for managing instances for Jenkins, 
it is important to understand what 
- [Jenkins Pipelines](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/) and 
- CasC ([Configuration as Code](https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin)) are.

Jenkins Pipelines use Scripts written in [Groovy](https://groovy-lang.org/) which aid in the CasC aspect of Jenkins.

Jenkins uses [plugins](https://plugins.jenkins.io/) like CasC to extend it's solution space by carrying out Jobs of different kinds and providing a composable infrastructure for your CI/CD.

### Out of the box it provides:
- Integration with Kubernetes ([Jenkins kubernetes-plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/kubernetes-plugin))
- Pipelines as Code ([Jenkins pipelines](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/))
- Extensibility via Groovy Scripts (similar to [Jenkins script console](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+Script+Console)) or ([configuration as code plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin))
- Secure Defaults and Hardening (see [the security section](https://jenkinsci.github.io/kubernetes-operator/docs/security/) of the documentation)

## Problem statement and goals

The main reason why we decided to implement the **Jenkins Operator** is the fact that we faced a lot of problems with standard Jenkins deployment.
We want to make Jenkins more robust, suitable for dynamic and multi-tenant environments. 

Some of the problems we want to solve:
- [installing plugins with incompatible versions or security vulnerabilities](https://jenkinsci.github.io/kubernetes-operator/docs/getting-started/latest/customization/#install-plugins)
- [better configuration as code](https://jenkinsci.github.io/kubernetes-operator/docs/getting-started/latest/customization/)
- [security and hardening out of the box](https://jenkinsci.github.io/kubernetes-operator/docs/security/)
- [make errors more visible for end users](https://jenkinsci.github.io/kubernetes-operator/docs/getting-started/latest/diagnostics/)
- [backup and restore for jobs history](https://jenkinsci.github.io/kubernetes-operator/docs/getting-started/latest/configure-backup-and-restore/)
- orphaned jobs with no JNLP connection
- handle graceful shutdown properly
- proper end to end tests for Jenkins lifecycle
